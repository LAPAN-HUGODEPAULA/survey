# Proposal: Add Survey Builder Application

This proposal outlines the creation of a new Flutter application, "survey-builder," dedicated to the management of surveys. This application will provide administrators or researchers with the ability to create, view, update, and delete surveys directly within the LAPAN Survey Platform ecosystem.

The primary goal is to offer a seamless and integrated experience for survey management, leveraging the existing design system to ensure UI/UX consistency with other platform applications.

This change will involve:
1.  Creating a new Flutter project for the `survey-builder` application.
2.  Developing the necessary UI screens for survey CRUD operations (List, Edit/Create, View).
3.  Extending the backend API (`survey-backend`) with new endpoints to support survey management.
4.  Integrating the new app with the backend via the generated API client.
